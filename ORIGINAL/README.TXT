INSTALLATION

See the book for details on installation.
  
INSTALL.BAT   will copy all the files to your hard drive.  
SOURCE.EXE    allows you to select chapters for copying.

     Be sure to name the drive you want to install to if 
	 you run install from Windows.  The error message passes 
	 to quickly to read before Windows grabs the screen back.  
     E.G., 

>INSTALL C

     will install the source code to C.


BUILDING THE CODE
****************

The programmer must change the paths to the libraries and include files 
to the correct path for their machine environment. Currently, 

VERSION 4.0 .IDE project files
all have been set to C:\BC45\LIB and C:\BC45\INCLUDE. 

VERSION 3.1 .PRJ project files
all have been set to C:\BORLANDC\LIB and C:\BORLANDC\INCLUDE. 


CODE CHANGES
************

The program files used in Build Your Own Flight Sim changed as the book was
being written. If the code doesn't match up exactly with the book, so be it--
thats what dynamic code is all about. 

This file, README.TXT, documents any of those changes. It will be updated as
necessary, both on the distribution disk provided with the book and in
the archive files, available on the Internet at

http://www.waite.com

that contain the current versions of the flight simulator code.
